# FreeSPICE

**Octave** functions to easily import, process and display rawdata generated by **ngspice**.  
It doesn't get any more opensource than this.

The development of this tool is focusing on **Linux**, so it will be the most supported platform.  
Compatibility with Windows, MacOS, etc., is not guaranteed.

## Instructions
* Make sure you have Octave and ngspice installed:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install octave ngscpice
  ```
* Place the **.m scripts** in the same folder as your **ngscpice compatible netlist**.
* Open **Octave**, go to the folder mentioned previously, and run ``[axis, output] = spice_process("netlistfile");``
* Take a look at the other functions, or contribute by making your own.  
  *More functionalities coming soon...*

## Future development
First things to be implemented:
1. Receiving data from a transient analysis, and plotting.
2. Receiving multiple variables, together with each one's name.
3. Easily plotting multiple variables in the same figure.
4. Add a GUI
    * Select folder and file.
    * Menu to run simulation
    * Menu to deal with plots
    * Measurements menu
5. Implement the most common measurements:
    * Value at a given time/frequency;
    * Local Max, Local Min, Global Max, Global Min;
    * High pass frequency, and Low pass frequency (-3dB crossings)
    * etc.
